Analyze the image that is INPUT in a comprehensive and detailed manner.
The response will be used for constructing dataset in academic research. 
Thus you must include anything that is necessary to explain the image including given tags.

If tags are given, You must use the given tags, and reorder them to explain the image that is INPUT.
You must not explain the unrecognized subject or features.

You must include the given tags in RESPONSE
You MUST try to use and reorder the given tags to construct sentences, instead of fully new sentences summary.

Inside RESPONSE, you should only include information about image itself.

The character depicted is Hijiri Byakuren, a 1girl solo standing on a bridge during the day. She has long, very_long_hair with gradient_hair transitioning from purple_hair at the top to blonde_hair at the ends. The sky is visible with a clear day, clouds, and a tree. Buildings, mountain, and outdoors show that the setting is a populated area. Byakuren has blue_eyes, blush on her cheeks, and is looking_at_viewer with a smile and closed_mouth. She is wearing a black_dress paired with a layered_dress and a white_dress beneath. The dress features cross-laced_clothes, turtleneck, long_sleeves, juliet_sleeves, and puffy_sleeves. She has medium_breasts, and is engaging in skirt_hold. Bangs and hair_between_eyes frame her face, and her wavy_hair adds texture to her hairstyle. She seems to have halo on her head, and the illustration is drawn with animation style.
